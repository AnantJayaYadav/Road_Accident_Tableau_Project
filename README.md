The Road Accident Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool designed using Tableau Software to provide an insightful and detailed overview of road accident data. This dashboard aims to help stakeholders understand the patterns, causes, and impacts of road accidents. By visualizing key metrics and trends, the dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making to enhance road safety measures and reduce accident occurrences.
